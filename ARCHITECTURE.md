# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This Laravel application is structured around the following main components:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests, business logic, and data orchestration.
- **Livewire Components**: Provide interactive UI for business profiles, services, reviews, and client/admin dashboards.
- **Models**: Represent database entities and relationships (User, Profile, Service, Review, PageView, VisitorSession).
- **Service Layer**: Contains reusable business logic (e.g., AnalyticsService).
- **Routes**: Define public and protected endpoints for web and API access.

### High-Level Data Flow
1. Users interact with Livewire components and controllers via web routes.
2. Controllers and components communicate with models and services to fetch, update, and display data.
3. Analytics and visitor tracking are handled by service classes and models.
4. Authentication and authorization are enforced via middleware and Laravel Fortify.

- Admin → [Web Routes] → [Controller/Livewire] → [Service Layer] → [Models] → [Database]

## Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: Laravel Fortify handles user registration, login, password reset, and two-factor authentication.
- **Authorization**: Middleware (`auth`, `verified`, `admin`) restricts access to protected routes.
- **Policies**: Model policies can be used for fine-grained access control.
- **Security Measures**:
  - Passwords are hashed.
  - Sensitive routes require authentication and verification.
  - Admin-only routes are protected by `admin` middleware.
  - CSRF protection is enabled by default.

## Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Laravel cache is used for configuration and query results where appropriate.
- **Query Optimization**: Eloquent relationships and indexes on foreign keys improve query speed.
- **Scalability**:
  - Database tables are normalized and indexed.
  - Visitor analytics are stored efficiently using session and page view tables.
  - Background jobs (if used) are managed via Laravel queues.

## Extensibility
- New features can be added via Livewire components, controllers, and service classes.
- The service layer allows for reusable business logic and analytics.
